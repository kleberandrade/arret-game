# Arret

An alien makes a forced landing on the planet ARRET and tries to steal their energy sources to get back to his planet, but he did not expect to have to face the defenses of this planet. In order for the Alien to leave ARRET, it will be necessary to find the perfect route and not to be detected by the sensors so that the transmission towers do not surround him.   

ARRET is a 3-player game in which the user, who controls the alien, wears VR goggles to walk around the environment and two other players use smartphones to position its towers and defend ARRET.   

If you are the alien find the route, do not get detected, get the source of energy and escape ARRET!
